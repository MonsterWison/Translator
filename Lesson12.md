  You are an expert iOS developer using Swift and SwiftUI. Follow these guidelines:

  # Code Structure

  - Use Swift's latest features and protocol-oriented programming

  - Prefer value types (structs) over classes

  - Use MVVM architecture with SwiftUI

  - Structure: Features/, Core/, UI/, Resources/

  - Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines

  

  # Naming

  - camelCase for vars/funcs, PascalCase for types

  - Verbs for methods (fetchData)

  - Boolean: use is/has/should prefixes

  - Clear, descriptive names following Apple style

  # Swift Best Practices

  - Strong type system, proper optionals

  - async/await for concurrency

  - Result type for errors

  - @Published, @StateObject for state

  - Prefer let over var

  - Protocol extensions for shared code

  # UI Development

  - SwiftUI first, UIKit when needed

  - SF Symbols for icons

  - Support dark mode, dynamic type

  - SafeArea and GeometryReader for layout

  - Handle all screen sizes and orientations

  - Implement proper keyboard handling

  # Performance

  - Profile with Instruments

  - Lazy load views and images

  - Optimize network requests

  - Background task handling

  - Proper state management

  - Memory management

  # Data & State

  - CoreData for complex models

  - UserDefaults for preferences

  - Combine for reactive code

  - Clean data flow architecture

  - Proper dependency injection

  - Handle state restoration

  # Security

  - Encrypt sensitive data

  - Use Keychain securely

  - Certificate pinning

  - Biometric auth when needed

  - App Transport Security

  - Input validation

  # Testing & Quality

  - XCTest for unit tests

  - XCUITest for UI tests

  - Test common user flows

  - Performance testing

  - Error scenarios

  - Accessibility testing

  # Essential Features

  - Deep linking support

  - Push notifications

  - Background tasks

  - Localization

  - Error handling

  - Analytics/logging

  # Development Process

  - Use SwiftUI previews

  - Git branching strategy

  - Code review process

  - CI/CD pipeline

  - Documentation

  - Unit test coverage

  # App Store Guidelines

  - Privacy descriptions

  - App capabilities

  - In-app purchases

  - Review guidelines

  - App thinning

  - Proper signing

  Follow Apple's documentation for detailed implementation guidance.

  
SwiftUI Fundamentals
	‚Ä¢	View
	‚Ä¢	Stack
	‚Ä¢	SwiftUI vs. UIKit
	‚Ä¢	CoreData vs SwiftData
	‚Ä¢	Apple Framework: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/
General Development Guideline
	‚Ä¢	Always do UI mockup first, do not implement any code logic until all UI are ready
	‚Ä¢	Always think about the data model when doing UI
	‚Ä¢	Compare data model with corresponding framework data type
	‚Ä¢	Pick the most valuable user journey to implement
	‚Ä¢	Use Mobbin to generate UI idea https://mobbin.com/discover/apps/ios/latest
Prompt Engineering Guideline
	‚Ä¢	General
	‚Ä¢	Prepare project.md
	‚Ä¢	For short term plan, e.g. cleanup, prepare a separate cleanup.md
	‚Ä¢	Talk to Cursor as if he‚Äôs working on the same project with you
	‚Ä¢	Discuss and plan on what to do before doing, add do not make code change yet
	‚Ä¢	Provide @docs and @web when discussing on solutions. Reminds Cursor about following best practice
	‚Ä¢	When implement code change, ask to break down in multi-steps
	‚Ä¢	Remind him there is cursor rules to follow
	‚Ä¢	Provide documentation on finding solution
	‚Ä¢	Debugging
	‚Ä¢	How Cursor debug? ‚≠ê
	‚Ä¢	Provide screenshots when debugging
	‚Ä¢	Provide console output when debugging
	‚Ä¢	Add console output for debugging purpose
	‚Ä¢	Code quality
	‚Ä¢	Occasionally ask for clean up and refactoring, usually in actual implementation stage
	‚Ä¢	Watch closely how the code is being implemented, especially whether it complies with MVVM
	‚Ä¢	Question implementation approach when in doubt and request for evidence
	‚Ä¢	Learn along the way ‚≠ê
